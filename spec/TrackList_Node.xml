      <p>
        Provides access to a short list of tracks which were recently played or
        will be played shortly.
        Example use cases are the list of tracks from the same album as the
        currently playing song or the
        <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/">Rhythmbox</a> play queue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each track in the tracklist has a unique identifier.
        The intention is that this uniquely identifies the track within
        the scope of the tracklist. In particular, if a media item
        (a particular music file, say) occurs twice in the track list, each
        occurrence should have a different identifier. If a track is removed
        from the middle of the playlist, it should not affect the track ids
        of any other tracks in the tracklist.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, the traditional track identifiers of URLs and position
        in the playlist cannot be used. Any scheme which satisfies the
        uniqueness requirements is valid, as clients should not make any
        assumptions about the value of the track id beyond the fact
        that it is a unique identifier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the (memory and processing) burden of implementing the
        TrackList interface and maintaining unique track ids for the
        playlist can be mitigated by only exposing a subset of the playlist when
        it is very long (the 20 or so tracks around the currently playing
        track, for example). This is a recommended practice as the tracklist
        interface is not designed to enable browsing through a large list of tracks,
        but rather to provide clients with context about the currently playing track.
