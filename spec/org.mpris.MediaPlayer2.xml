          appropriate mechanism available.
        </p>
        <p>
          The media player may be unable to control how its user interface
          is displayed, or it may not have a graphical user interface at all.
          In this case, the <tp:member-ref>CanRaise</tp:member-ref> property is
          <strong>false</strong> and this method does nothing.

          The media player may refuse to allow clients to shut it down.

          <strong>false</strong> and this method does nothing.

          Note: Media players which can be D-Bus activated, or for which there is
          no sensibly easy way to terminate a running instance (via the main
          interface or a notification area icon for example) should allow clients
          to use this method. Otherwise, it should not be needed.

          This can be viewed as protocols supported by the player in almost
