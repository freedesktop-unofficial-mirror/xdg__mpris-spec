If you want to suggest changes or additions to the specification, you should
only have to edit the XML files in spec/.

The system for producing the HTML output is kept closely in sync with the
Telepathy system.  Currently, the only differences are the Makefile and one
or two files in doc/templates/.  Any fixes to this system should almost
certainly be passed upstream.

Please send patches to mpris@lists.freedesktop.org
